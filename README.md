A NativeScript keyboard observer that utilizes [KWKeyboardListener](https://github.com/kwarter/KWKeyboardListener) for iOS.

## Installation

`$ tns plugin add nativescript-na-keyboard`

## Usage

Simply require the plugin and do as such:

```js
var NAKeyboard = require("nativescript-na-keyboard");

NAKeyboard.on("open close", function(eventData) {
  console.log(eventData.eventName); // Returns either "open" or "close".
  console.dump(eventData.keyboardFrame); // Returns position and size of the keyboard.
});
```

### Methods

#### setAvoidingView()

`setAvoidingView(view)`

* **view** - The view that should be pulled when the keyboard opens.

```js
var view = page.getViewById("inputText"); // The TextField view
NAKeyboard.setAvoidingView(view);
```
